# Understanding your audience’s expertise level is crucial in shaping how you present technical information. Here are some key ways it influences your approach:
Language and Terminology:
Tech Experts: Use industry-specific jargon and technical terms. Experts are familiar with these terms and expect precise, detailed explanations.
Regular Folks: Simplify the language and avoid jargon. Use analogies and everyday examples to make complex concepts more relatable12.
Depth of Information:
Tech Experts: Provide in-depth analysis, detailed data, and comprehensive explanations. Experts appreciate thoroughness and technical depth.

Gain a thorough understanding of each audience’s unique needs, interests, and concerns.
Verify that our identification of their needs is accurate and up-to-date.
Tailor every message to suit the intended audience and align with our overarching vision.
Deliver each message using a medium that is easily accessible and understandable to the target audience(s).

Don’t Assume Prior Knowledge

If you know you are writing for people outside of your field or for a mixed audience, you don’t want to talk down to them, but you should assume they really have no prior knowledge of the subject you study or the field you work in. It can be tricky to find a balance between making sure everyone understands and oversimplifying. In the example with my fifth graders and Fortnite, it would have been reasonable for them to assume readers know the terms “video games,” “controllers,” and “characters” but unreasonable for them to assume readers know what “aimbot,” “box fight,” and “bunny hop” mean in the Fortnite context.

If you are not sure about what is common knowledge and what would be unreasonable to expect someone outside your field to know, here’s a suggestion: Have someone outside your field read what you’ve written and give you some feedback on what is clear and what is not.

Be Clear and Concise

Being clear and concise is important no matter what you are writing or for whom. Try to state your point briefly and without extra words, phrases, or clauses. Look for unnecessarily complicated words, phrases that can be shortened, and ideas that can be simplified.

For example: “John Starr is of the opinion that in the process of engaging in relevant discourse, the main point was thoroughly obfuscated by the researchers unknowingly, which may have led to the negative results” could be trimmed back to, “John Starr believes that while discussing the topic the researchers confused the main point, which may have led to the negative results.”

Being concise is especially important in any situation where it might be more difficult for the audience to understand the writing, such as special topics presented to nonspecialists. A good idea to be more concise is to finish a written piece, set it aside a day, and then read it again with the idea of cutting anything that is not strictly needed. Or, of course, you can ask an editor.

We’ve all had the experience of talking to someone using “big words” and being left feeling confused, maybe even embarrassed to admit to your confusion. With writing, embarrassed or not,  your readers  don’t even have the option to ask if they’re confused. So when writing for a general audience, it’s critical to consider making your writing accessible to all by avoiding jargon, considering what is common knowledge and what is not, and being concise.

Ensuring your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge is crucial for inclusivity. Here are some effective techniques:
Simplify Language: Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon and technical terms. If you must use them, provide explanations or a glossary.
Use Visual Aids: Incorporate images, diagrams, and videos to explain complex concepts. Ensure these visuals have descriptive alt text for those using screen readers1.
Organize Content Logically: Structure your content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points. This makes it easier to scan and understand2.

Simplifying terms can make a big difference in how easily people understand your content. Here are a few examples:
Technical Term: “Initiate the process.” Simplified Term: “Start the process.” Improvement: “Start” is a common word that most people understand immediately, whereas “initiate” might require more thought, especially for those with limited technical knowledge.

Relatability: Examples connect new information to familiar situations. For instance, explaining cloud storage by comparing it to a virtual filing cabinet helps people understand the concept more easily.
Context: Examples provide context, showing how a concept applies in real-world scenarios. This makes abstract ideas more concrete and understandable.
Step-by-Step Guidance: Examples can break down processes into manageable steps. For instance, a cooking recipe with step-by-step instructions is easier to follow than a general description of the cooking process.

Illustrations: Help in explaining abstract concepts or processes. They can make complex information more relatable and easier to understand.
Example: Medical procedures, user manuals.
Icons: Provide quick visual cues and enhance readability. They are useful for highlighting important points or actions.
Example: User interfaces, instructional guides.
By choosing the right type of visual for your specific technical information, you can enhance comprehension and retention for your audience. Do you have a particular type of information you’re looking to visualize?

When new users begin utilizing your software, the first documentation they’ll probably look at will be the README file.

This text serves as an introduction to your project, explaining its purpose and providing instructions on how to use it.

In other words, the README is a guide that helps users navigate your software.

However, for a README to be helpful, there are certain indispensable sections this document should contain.

For instance, imagine if you omitted the installation instructions—how would developers even start using the software?

That’s why we’ve compiled this article—so you have a comprehensive list of elements your README should contain.
